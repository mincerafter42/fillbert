Fillbert is a webcomic created by [me, Vivi](https://mincerafter42.github.io). It should work with all major browsers _but not Internet Explorer. How is Internet Explorer still a thing; it's so incompatible with many Web technologies_

The comics are in the [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) format. I draw them in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and then hand-edit them, which allows me to make them more compact (because Inkscape's optimization is often not very smart).  
I have no clue what Inkscape's doing with coordinate spaces half the time.

This site uses the [ISO 8601 week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) as its date format, as I aim to publish one comic every week.

The web site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You can [view the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mincerafter42/fillbert).

Using SVG for the comics gives such advantages as:
- no matter how much you zoom in, the comics are still crisp
- I work better in vector art than raster
- The comics have a small filesize.
  - This is an important factor to users like me
  - To put it in professional terms, my Internet connection is frikkin' slow
- SVG animations!
  - Inkscape doesn't support SVG animations so all of those are added by hand too
