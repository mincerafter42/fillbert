Fillbert is a webcomic created by [me, Vivi](https://mincerafter42.github.io).

The comics are all <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVGs</abbr>, drawn in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and hand-edited by me to reduce redundancy, mostly with the `<use>` element.  
I have no clue what Inkscape's doing with coordinate spaces half the time.

The web site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You can [view the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mincerafter42/fillbert).

Using SVG for the comics gives such advantages as:
- no matter how much you zoom in, the comics are still crisp
- I work better in vector art than raster
- The comics have a small filesize.
  - This is an important factor to users like me
  - To put it in professional terms, my Internet connection is frikkin&#39; slow
