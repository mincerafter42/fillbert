<i>Fillbert</i> is a webcomic created by [me, Vivi](https://mincerafter42.github.io). It should work with browsers that fully support HTML![5](https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Badge.svg){:height='20' width='20' style='vertical-align:text-bottom'}, [![CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Buttons/csso.svg){:height='22' width='62' style='vertical-align:text-bottom'}](//www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Buttons)3, and [![SVG](https://www.w3.org/Icons/SVG/Buttons/svg-w3c-blue.svg){:height='21' style='vertical-align:text-bottom'}](//www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/)2.  
The comics are published weekly.

## Tech

The comics are in the [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) format. I draw them in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and then hand-edit them, which allows me to make them more compact (because Inkscape's optimization is often not very smart).  
I have no clue what Inkscape's doing with coordinate spaces half the time.

Using SVG for the comics gives such advantages as:
- no matter how much you zoom in, the comics are still crisp
- I work better in vector art than raster
- The comics have a small filesize.
  - This is an important factor to users like me.  
    To put it in professional terms, my Internet connection is frikkin' slow
- SVG animations!
  - Inkscape doesn't support SVG animations so all of those are added by hand too

This site uses the [ISO 8601 week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) as its date format.

The web site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You can [view the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mincerafter42/fillbert).
