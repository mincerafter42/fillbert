<p>If you're reading this, it means I didn't draw the comic in time. Oops.
<p>It was gonna be this cool comic, set <em>offline</em>, where Fillbert as they looked in <a href=../2021/W25>2021-W25</a> would be in this secret time travel lab and a scientist would be like "How did you get into our secret time travel labâ€½" and Fillbert would be like "Through the empty space on your math notes. How did <em>you</em> get into your secret time travel lab?" and then Fillbert would unintentionally enter a time machine and the comic'd answer the question of how Fillbert time travelled.
<p>Perhaps I'll draw it in the future and you can come back later and see it.
