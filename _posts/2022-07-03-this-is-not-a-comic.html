<p>ok I thought I'd be able to handle the workload of a weekly comic, but once my backlog's run out it seems I can't make myself produce comics at a consistent rate.
<p>Thus, Fillbert Comix are switching from a weekly schedule to a "whenever I want" schedule.<br>Can't procrastinate when you have no deadlines! :p
<p>I wanted to finish this arc before making the schedule change; there's only like 3 planned comics left in the arc and I didn't want to delay it, but there's no way I can make the next comic in the next 20 minutes.
<p>I might take a break from drawing comics; imposing deadlines on myself was not fun.
